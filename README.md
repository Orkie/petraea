# petraea
ARM9 Emulator

Named after the [Sessile Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_petraea), which is hard for a casual observer to differentiate from the more common English Oak. Hopefully it will be equally difficult to tell whether software is running on this emulator, or the more common Acorn-designed processor.
